  <p>Zach is a person of many <strong>HOBBIES.</strong> Most of which revolve around <strong>GAMES</strong> and <strong>PERFORMING.</strong> All of which are <strong>DEEP PASSIONS.</strong> He spends most of his free time doing <strong>NERDY ACTIVITIES</strong> 
  with his <strong>NERDY FAMILY.</strong> He has a love for <strong>BUILDING AND PAINTING PLASTIC MODELS.</strong> But can't do it often because it <strong>TAKES UP TOO MUCH TIME.</strong> Lately, he has enjoyed reading <strong>COMIC BOOKS,</strong> which has
  bolstered his old love of <strong>CREATIVE WRITING.</strong> He has a large collection of <strong>OBSCURE BOARD GAMES</strong> that only get played <strong>TWICE A YEAR</strong> because he's too busy always playing <strong>TABLETOP ROLE-PLAYING GAMES.</strong>
  He hasn't been in a <strong>STAGE PRODUCTION</strong> since <strong>HIGH SCHOOL.</strong> So he uses the <strong>CHARACTER ACTING</strong> and <strong>STORYTELLING</strong> of <strong>DUNGEONS & DRAGONS</strong> to scratch his <strong>PERFORMANCE ARTIST</strong>
  itch. This is also done through filling his house with <strong>MUSIC.</strong> Of which he is always <strong>SINGING ALONG</strong> or <strong>LEARNING ON PIANO</strong> because he <strong>CAN'T WRITE HIS OWN MUSIC.</strong> Most of the time, however, he can
  be found playing <strong>VIDEO GAMES</strong> and considers himself <strong>QUITE GOOD AT THEM.</strong> In fact, he <strong>PRIDES HIMSELF</strong> on being <strong>VERY SKILLED</strong> at all his hobbies. This is because he is <strong>HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.</strong>
  So becoming <strong>THE BEST</strong> at the things he is passionate about is <strong>ALSO HIS PASSION.</strong>
