  <p>About
    My name is Zach Wilson and I'm currently taking my first steps into the world of programming and web development. This is a field I've had great interest
    in for a majority of my life and I'm extremely excited to be diving in headfirst. I live with my my wife Katherine, my brother Chris, and my roommate Sean. Many of my
    family's interests revolve around technology, so picking up coding languages is a skill that has always been within eyeshot. Though I live in Portland, Oregon, my family
    spends half its time living out in the country of Central Oregon to keep my mother company. Living our lives in two separate places means being able to work remotely
    is a high priority in my life. However, I am more than prepared to repay this flexibility with effort and loyalty.

  <p>Zach is a person of many <strong>HOBBIES.</strong> Most of which revolve around <strong>GAMES</strong> and <strong>PERFORMING.</strong> All of which are
  <strong>DEEP PASSIONS.</strong>He spends most of his free time doing <strong>NERDY ACTIVITIES</strong> with his <strong>NERDY FAMILY.</strong> He has a love for
  <strong>BUILDING AND PAINTING PLASTIC MODELS.</strong> But can't do it often because it <strong>TAKES UP TOO MUCH TIME.</strong> Lately, he has enjoyed reading 
  <strong>COMIC BOOKS,</strong> which has bolstered his old love of <strong>CREATIVE WRITING.</strong> He has a large collection of <strong>OBSCURE BOARD GAMES</strong>
  that only get played <strong>TWICE A YEAR</strong> because he's too busy always playing <strong>TABLETOP ROLE-PLAYING GAMES.</strong> He hasn't been in a 
  <strong>STAGE PRODUCTION</strong> since <strong>HIGH SCHOOL</strong> so he uses the <strong>CHARACTER ACTING</strong> and <strong>STORYTELLING</strong> of 
  <strong>DUNGEONS & DRAGONS</strong> to scratch his <strong>PERFORMANCE ARTIST itch.</strong> This is also done through filling his house with <strong>MUSIC.</strong> 
  Of which he is always <strong>SINGING ALONG</strong> or <strong>LEARNING ON PIANO</strong> because he <strong>CAN'T WRITE HIS OWN MUSIC.</strong> Most of the time, 
  however, he can be found playing <strong>VIDEO GAMES</strong> and considers himself <strong>QUITE GOOD AT THEM.</strong> In fact, he <strong>PRIDES HIMSELF</strong> 
  on being <strong>VERY SKILLED</strong> at all of his hobbies. This is thanks to him being a <strong>FAST LEARNER</strong> with a <strong>GREAT MEMORY.</strong> 
  He is a <strong>HIGHLY COMPETITIVE</strong> person who loves <strong>TESTING HIMSELF,</strong> so becoming <strong>THE BEST</strong> at the things he is 
  passionate about is <strong>ALSO HIS PASSION.</strong></p>
